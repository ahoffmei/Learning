## File Storage vs Object Storage 
### File Storage 
Typical file is broken into blocks and stored on the disk.  Very slow and not a lot of metadata. 

### Object Storage 
Flat address space (storage pool) used for storing files 
- Scalable 
- Efficient and cost effective

## Object Storage
An object is determined via a key rather than a file path. This key will look like a file path, but won't actually be accessed using the traditional file explorer structure most users are familiar to. 

Example key: `/assets/prefix/img.png`
