# How the Internet Works

# Access Networks
Physically connect systems to routers. 
- Home access networks use DSL, Cabel, or Fiber Optic to link homes to the internet. 
- Institutional access networks are the same but specific for businesses. Usually use fiber optics. 
- Mobile is the same for phones

# Routers 
Handle the task of package forwarding. Use packet switching, break down data into small packets that can be sent throughout the network, using a simple header payload format. 

## Forwarding Tables
Have the IP to determine where to forward to. These are tries, which take a chunk of the IP to determine where to route next in an efficient manner.

# User Input (Client Side) 
Say user enters https://google.com  
`https://` --> Hypter Text Transport Protocol (Secure)
`google.com` --> DNS server uses this to get Google's IP
